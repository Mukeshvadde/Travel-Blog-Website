<b>Gustave Eiffel's Vision</b><br>

Designed by the brilliant engineer Gustave Eiffel, the tower was constructed as the centerpiece of the 1889 Exposition Universelle, a world's fair celebrating the 100th anniversary of the French Revolution. Gustave Eiffel's design was selected from a pool of over 100 submissions, and construction began in 1887. At a height of 324 meters (1,063 feet), it was the tallest man-made structure in the world at the time.

The tower's intricate lattice structure, comprising 18,038 individual iron pieces and 2.5 million rivets, is a marvel of precision engineering. It was designed to withstand the elements, making it remarkably resilient to wind and weather. The Eiffel Tower boasts three observation decks, each offering breathtaking views of the City of Light. The first level, at 57 meters (187 feet), is home to restaurants and an immersive glass floor. The second level, at 115 meters (377 feet), features an array of shops, dining options, and even a museum showcasing the tower's history. The third and highest level, at 276 meters (906 feet), provides panoramic views that stretch for miles.
